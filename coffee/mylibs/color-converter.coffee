# Very small helper library to deal with conversions between color systems.
#
# Currently supports:
#
#   * HSV and RGB only
#
# Expected formats:
#
#   * HSV in the format: `{h: hue, s: saturation, v: value}`
#   * RGB in the format: `{r: red, g: green, b: blue}`
#
# Expected ranges:
#
#   * `0 <= hue < 360` (values outside this range will wrap)
#   * `0 <= saturation, value <= 1` (values will be cropped to fit)
#   * `0 <= red, green, blue <= 255` (values will be cropped to fit)
